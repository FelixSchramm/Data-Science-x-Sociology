**Description of the project:** 

- **Classification of Social Milieus in Europe:**   
  This project aims to classify social milieus across European countries using machine learning models applied to large-scale survey data. The goal is to identify latent social groupings based on values, lifestyles, socioeconomic status, and political orientations. Supervised and unsupervised learning techniques will be used to build robust, interpretable models. The analysis seeks to uncover cross-national patterns and culturally specific milieu structures. Results will contribute to a deeper understanding of social stratification and identity in contemporary Europe.
